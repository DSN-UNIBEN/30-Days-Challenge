# **Day 23: Evaluation Metrics (Part 1)**

Welcome to day 23. 

We’ll be looking at Evaluation Metrics. 

Imagine training a model that seems perfect, only to discover it falls flat on unseen data. 

Evaluation metrics prevent such surprises by providing

1.	Quantifiable measures to gauge your model's strengths and weaknesses.

2.	Guidance on model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and overall project development.

# *Hands-on Practice*

1.	Choose a machine learning model you've built previously.

2.	Watch the video, focusing on the metrics relevant to your model's task (classification or regression).

3.	Calculate the chosen metrics using the provided formulas or code examples.

4.	Analyze the results, interpreting what they reveal about your model's performance.

5.	Don't hesitate to share your findings and experiences in the community forum!

Stay tuned for Day 24.
