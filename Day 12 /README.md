# **Day 12: Data Preprocessing (Part 1)**

Welcome back.

Today, we will dive into data preprocessing, the foundation of successful machine learning. 

# *Playlist*

This 27-video playlist, spread across Days 12-14, equips you with the essential skills to clean, transform, and prepare your data for machine learning algorithms. 

Today, we kick off with the first nine videos. 

# *Hands-on Practice*

•	Watch videos 1-9 from the playlist, actively following along and applying the concepts to your chosen dataset.

•	Select a real-world dataset from Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or a source of your choice.

Tomorrow, we continue our data preprocessing journey with videos 10-18.

Stay tuned!
