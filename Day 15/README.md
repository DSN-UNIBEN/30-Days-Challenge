# **Day 15: Feature Engineering (Part 1)**

Welcome to day 15.

We will be looking at feature engineering. 

Data preprocessing prepares your data, but feature engineering takes it a step further, crafting informative features for your models.

This comprehensive 1-hour video, spread across Days 15 and 16, equips you with the essential skills, whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist.

# *Hands-on Exploration*
•	Choose a dataset you've worked with previously or find a new one from Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or a source of your choice.

•	Watch the first half of the video (approximately 30 minutes), actively following along and applying the concepts to your chosen dataset.

•	Don't hesitate to pause, rewind, and explore further. Remember, practice is key to mastering these techniques.
Community Connect:

•	Share your feature engineering challenges and initial explorations in our community forum.

•	Discuss the concepts you're learning and seek help from others' experiences.
