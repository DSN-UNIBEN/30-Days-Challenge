# *Hands-on Practice*

1.	Choose a simple machine learning model you've built previously.

2.	Watch the relevant parts of the video and follow the integration steps.

3.	Adapt the code examples to your specific model and data types.

4.	Test your app thoroughly, ensuring it takes user input, makes predictions, and displays results correctly.

Share your progress and challenges in the forum! Discuss your model integration approaches, seek help if needed, and learn from others' experiences.
