# *Key Concepts*

•	Explore the versatile cross_val_score function for seamless cross-validation implementation.

•	Learn how to tailor cross-validation to your specific needs by adjusting parameters like cv (number of folds) and scoring (performance metric).

•	Discover how to analyze cross-validation scores, identify model strengths and weaknesses, and make informed decisions.

# *Hands-on Practice*

1.	Choose a dataset and machine learning model you've previously worked with.

2.	Import necessary libraries, including scikit-learn's cross_val_score and relevant model classes.

Stay tuned for Day 19.
